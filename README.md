Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics such as mean, standard deviation, and count, so on, often with visual methods. This analysis explores the air quality in various Indian states from 1990-2015.


# Project Description

This project analyzes levels of various pollutants in India by state. The results are used to calculate air quality, which is then compared among the states with a focus on Andhra Pradesh.

## Steps

 1. Cleaning the Data
 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
 3. Interpreting the Results

## Requirements

**Python.** Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. 

**Integrated Development Environment (IDE).** Any IDE that can be used to view, edit, and run Python code, such as:
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

### Packages 
Install the following packages in Python prior to running the code.
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
## Launch
Download the Python File *India_Air_Quality_CA01_Silvia_Ji.ipynb* and open it in the IDE. Download and import the dataset *data.csv*.
